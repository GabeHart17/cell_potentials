Cell potential data from [GSU HyperPhysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/electpot.html#c1)

`electropot.html` is the raw html from that page, which was processed to make `potentials.csv`.
`potentials_reformatted.csv` is the same except ions are formatted as *Cu+2(2)* rather than *Cu2+(s)*
